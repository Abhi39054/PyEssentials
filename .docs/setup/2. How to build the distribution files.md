# How to build the distribution files.

You need the sdist (source distribution) and the .whl (wheel) file before publishing.

Ensure Build Tools are Installed:

Bash

pip install build twine


Run the Build Command: This generates the distribution files based on your setup.cfg and pyproject.toml.

Bash

python -m build


This command will populate the new dist/ directory.
