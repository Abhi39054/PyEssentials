* **Performance:** Includes the ready-to-use `@timeit` decorator for simple function benchmarking.
* **Code Clarity:** Provides utility functions for common tasks like string manipulation (e.g., casing). (Coming soon!)
* **Scalability:** Structured for easy addition of new utility groups (e.g., `networking`, `file_io`, `validation`).

`PyEssentials` is currenlty still in development stage. Once development is completed, It will be published in the Pypi for the community to use.
